# Requirements: marmot-ts — v1.0 catchup (resync to marmot spec + MDK Rust)

**Defined:** 2026-07-21
**Core Value:** A downstream client can join a Marmot group and exchange messages that interoperate, byte-for-byte, with any spec-conformant peer (incl. the Rust MDK reference), across every supported runtime.

Grounded in the catchup review — see `.planning/research/SUMMARY.md` (+ PROOF-V2 / SPEC-DELTAS / MDK-INTEROP). Upstream: `refs/marmot` (spec, post-split) and `refs/mdk` (`marmotkit-v0.9.4`). Per project constraint, the Rust reference is authoritative for wire format where it is ahead of spec.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for catching marmot-ts up to feature parity + byte-for-byte interop with the current MDK Rust reference. Interop-breakers close first. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Proof (account-identity-proof v2)

- [x] **PROOF-01**: account-identity-proof migrates v1→v2 — version byte `2`, and the 64-byte Schnorr signature signs the canonical Nostr **kind-450 event id** (not the old SHA-256 domain preimage); marmot-ts produces and verifies v2 byte-for-byte with MDK, and per-ciphersuite signature-scheme tag values match the Rust `signature_algorithm() as u16` decimals (interop-breaking; `src/core/account-identity-proof.ts`, mdk #755)

### Security / inbound trust

- [x] **SEC-01**: The inbound Nostr path verifies event id + Schnorr signature at the boundary BEFORE trusting `h`/`p` routing tags or attempting decryption; unverifiable events are rejected, not processed (interop-breaking/security; `groups-manager.ts` → `nostr-peeler.ts` → `group-message-crypto.ts`; `transports/nostr.md` #236, mdk #727)

### Wire / codec conformance

- [x] **WIRE-01**: Published KeyPackages cap the MLS Lifetime to the 84-day maximum (≤ 7,261,200 s), and inbound KeyPackages with an over-long or expired Lifetime are rejected (interop-breaking; `src/utils/timestamp.ts`, `key-package-event-decode.ts`, `key-package-eligibility.ts`; `foundation/key-packages.md` #236)
- [x] **WIRE-02**: Required-tag cardinality is enforced — events with repeated, empty, or duplicate required tags are rejected (445 `h`; 1059 `p`; 444 `e`/`relays`; 30443 `d`/`i`/`mls_protocol_version`) (interop-breaking; `src/utils/nostr.ts`, `key-package-event-decode.ts`, `welcome-event.ts`; `transports/nostr.md` #236)
- [x] **WIRE-03**: App-component integrity is validated on staged commits — a commit that drops the `app_data_dictionary`, drops a required component, or rewrites a required component's bytes outside a validated `AppDataUpdate` is rejected pre-merge (interop-breaking; `src/engine/ingest.ts` + send + convergence; mdk cgka-engine #704)
- [x] **WIRE-04**: SafeAAD component (`0x0002`) is defined, `0x0001` is advertised in the leaf `app_components` list, and the empty safe_aad entry is emitted, so LeafNode/KeyPackage bytes match the reference (additive; `src/core/components/ids.ts`, `dictionary.ts`; mdk `b9ae3ce`)

### Convergence / membership parity

- [x] **CONV-01**: Admin/leaf coupling is enforced as a resulting-epoch invariant — every membership-changing commit is validated (send + inbound) so that admins ⊆ member leaves, matching MDK's legality decision for removal-without-policy-update commits (additive/convergence; `src/core/components/admin-policy.ts`, `src/engine/admin-policy.ts`; `admin-policy-v1.md`+`convergence.md` #171, mdk #701)
- [x] **CONV-02**: SelfEvicted / Realizing removal is handled — on being removed, marmot-ts emits a self-removed notification, marks the group removed-inactive, and classifies later input as SelfEvicted/stale (additive; new; `member-departure.md` #171)
- [x] **CONV-03**: Group-state-change notifications are attributed to their `commit_digest` and withdrawn when that commit is superseded on rewind, including clearing removal markers (additive; `src/engine/` convergence, cf. `delivered-payloads.ts`; `convergence.md` #171, mdk #724)
- [x] **CONV-04**: Own-confirmed-commit convergence protection is verified against MDK scenario vectors — a device's own published+confirmed commit is never rolled back for a same-epoch sibling; fixes are added only if marmot-ts diverges (verify-first; `src/engine/fork-recovery.ts`, `tree-convergence.ts`; mdk #706/#723/#702, #724)
- [ ] **CONV-05**: Every valid Commit that changes `marmot.group.lifecycle.v1` to `disbanded` enters the existing bounded convergence pass even on a linear edge, without changing pass identity, deadline, base epoch, or branch scoring; terminalization occurs only when that branch is selected canonically

### Group lifecycle / disbanding

- [ ] **LIFE-01**: Implement `marmot.group.lifecycle.v1` (`0x800c`) with the exact one-byte active/disbanded codec, required enablement for new groups, legacy-group compatibility, required-component immutability, capability checks, and full parent-relative disband Commit validation
- [ ] **LIFE-02**: Selected disbanding is an absorbing, durable, publicly observable terminal state with one actor-attributed event, typed outbound rejection, terminal inbound classification, restart-safe tombstone cleanup, and a durable local disband request that regenerates against a selected active branch until it terminalizes or loses membership/admin authority

### Conformance vectors

- [x] **CONF-01**: MDK reference vectors are wired up as cross-impl tests — `nostr-routing-v1` byte-fixtures against `src/core/components/nostr-routing.ts` (incl. duplicate-relay reject), the convergence/admin-policy/fork-recovery scenario vectors as a parity harness, and a proof-v2 Rust-signed→TS-verified round-trip fixture

### Quality gate

- [ ] **QA-01**: Full test suite green across all supported runtimes (Node 20/22/24, Deno 2, Bun latest/1.1) at milestone end
- [ ] **QA-02**: Every catch-up change with a byte-exact MDK counterpart is cross-checked against the Rust reference output and the result recorded

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future milestones. Cataloged by the review but not built now.

### Multi-device (MIP-06)

- **MDEV-01**: extension 0xf2f0, External-Commit carve-out, join-PSK exporter, pairing payload — deferred; orthogonal to single-device interop

### Push notifications (MIP-05)

- **PUSH-01**: owner-authenticated push-token gossip (BIP-340 sigs, tombstones, LWW ordering) per spec #725 — deferred

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.
