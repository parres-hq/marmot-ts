# Roadmap: marmot-ts — v1.0 catchup (resync to marmot spec + MDK Rust reference)

## Overview

The darkmatter repo split into `refs/marmot` (spec) and `refs/mdk` (Rust reference, now at
`marmotkit-v0.9.4`, far ahead of the `v0.2.0`-era baseline marmot-ts was last audited against).
The catchup review (`.planning/research/SUMMARY.md` + PROOF-V2/SPEC-DELTAS/MDK-INTEROP) found
5 interop-breaking gaps, 4 additive convergence/feature gaps, and 2 parity items needing a
targeted verify. This milestone closes them in strict severity order: Proof v2 first (the
headline known breaker, isolated because it touches identity/credential machinery), then the
inbound-trust and wire-boundary tightening, then commit-integrity and convergence parity, then
remaining feature parity plus wiring up MDK's own conformance vectors, and finally a green
cross-runtime quality gate. Multi-device (MIP-06), push (MIP-05), the QUIC data-plane, and
app/tooling crates are cataloged by the review but explicitly deferred.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**

- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [x] **Phase 1: Proof v2** - Migrate account-identity-proof v1→v2 to close the headline interop-breaker (completed 2026-07-21)
- [x] **Phase 2: Inbound Trust & Wire Boundary** - Verify-before-trust, KeyPackage lifetime cap, required-tag cardinality (completed 2026-07-22)
- [x] **Phase 3: Commit Integrity & Convergence Parity** - App-component integrity, admin/leaf coupling, SelfEvicted, notification withdrawal, own-commit protection (all 7 plans executed; completion held through 3 code-review rounds — see 03-REVIEW.md. The CR-08/CR-11 own-commit convergence defect class has moved to Phase 4 for a structural fix; Phase 3's remaining scope is its local findings CR-12/CR-13/CR-14, the round-1 carry-forwards, and WR-24's stale MIP citations) (completed 2026-09-01)
- [x] **Phase 3.1: Phase 3 Review Closure** (INSERTED) - Close the 30 open findings from 03-REVIEW.md round 3; excludes CR-08/CR-11, which moved to Phase 4 (completed 2026-09-02)
- [ ] **Phase 4: Feature Parity & Conformance Vectors** - SafeAAD advertisement, MDK's own test vectors as cross-impl tests, and the own-commit convergence stamp port that closes CR-08/CR-11
- [ ] **Phase 4.1: Terminal Group Disbanding** (INSERTED) - New `marmot.group.lifecycle.v1` `disbanded` component and its forced `Stable → Recovering` admission rule
- [ ] **Phase 5: Quality Gate** - Green suite on every supported runtime; byte-exact MDK cross-checks recorded

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Proof v2

**Goal**: marmot-ts implements account-identity-proof v2 (version byte `2`, signing the
canonical Nostr kind-450 event id instead of the old SHA-256 domain preimage) so it
interoperates byte-for-byte with the MDK Rust reference — the headline interop-breaker closed
in isolation before any other wire-boundary work begins.
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: PROOF-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. marmot-ts emits and accepts only version byte `2` account-identity-proofs; a v1-only proof (version byte `1`) is now rejected.
2. A v2 proof produced by marmot-ts is accepted by MDK-equivalent verification logic, proven via a Rust-signed → TS-verified round-trip fixture (no shared byte fixture exists yet, so this is generated fresh).
3. Per-ciphersuite `signature_scheme` decimal tag values emitted by marmot-ts match the Rust `signature_algorithm() as u16` decimal for every supported ciphersuite.
4. The unpublished kind-450 proof event carries its six tags (`d`, `extension`, `version`, `ciphersuite`, `signature_scheme`, `mls_signature_key`) in the exact Rust order/format and is never published/relayed.
   **Plans**: 2/2 plans complete

Plans:
**Wave 1**

- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Migrate core account-identity-proof v1→v2 (version byte 2, kind-450 event-id signing digest, external-signer parity builders, signature_scheme parity, colocated v2 tests)

**Wave 2** _(blocked on Wave 1 completion)_

- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Thread widened signer contract through client, sweep proof-touching tests to v2, and pin a fresh Rust-signed → TS-verified round-trip fixture + never-published assertion

### Phase 2: Inbound Trust & Wire Boundary

**Goal**: The inbound Nostr path only trusts events after verifying their id and signature,
and published/consumed KeyPackages plus required tags conform to the tightened #236 wire
boundary — a conformant peer no longer silently accepts malformed input or forges trust in
unverified fields.
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: SEC-01, WIRE-01, WIRE-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. An inbound event with an invalid Nostr event id or Schnorr signature is rejected before any `h`/`p` routing tag is trusted or any decryption is attempted.
2. Published KeyPackages cap their MLS Lifetime at ≤ 7,261,200 s (84 days); an inbound KeyPackage with an over-long or expired Lifetime is rejected rather than accepted for eligibility.
3. An event with a repeated, empty, or duplicate required tag (445 `h`; 1059 `p`; 444 `e`/`relays`; 30443 `d`/`i`/`mls_protocol_version`) is rejected, not silently resolved by taking the first match.
   **Plans**: 4/4 plans complete

Plans:
**Wave 1**

- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Shared trust-boundary primitives: RejectReason taxonomy + injectable verifier defaults (verify.ts), table-driven #236 tag-cardinality validator + strict getters (tag-cardinality.ts), and produce-side KeyPackage lifetime cap/backdate/rename + cap/grace helpers (timestamp.ts)

**Wave 2** _(depends on Wave 1)_

- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Inject the pluggable VerifyEventMethod through MarmotClient; gate the 445 drain and 1059 ingest on verify-before-trust with typed `rejected` emits; migrate 444 `e`/`relays` reads to the strict getters

**Wave 3** _(depends on Wave 2)_

- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md — Close the 30443 KeyPackage boundary on both consumption paths (track()/addPublished and createInviteIntent): outer-event verify, `d`/`i`/`mls_protocol_version` cardinality, and inbound Lifetime cap/current rejection, plus the eligibility Lifetime reason

**Gap closure** _(from 02-VERIFICATION.md)_

- [x] 02-04-PLAN.md — Close the three verified defects: enforce 1059 `p`-tag cardinality in InviteManager.ingestEvent (GAP 1/WIRE-02), reorder the 445 #connectGroup drain so only verified events occupy the dedup slot — fixing the WR-01 same-id forgery censorship (GAP 2/SEC-01), and make createWelcomeRumor reject duplicate relay URLs to match its own strict consumer (GAP 3/WIRE-02)

### Phase 3: Commit Integrity & Convergence Parity

**Goal**: Staged commits and membership/convergence handling match MDK's legality and rewind
semantics so the two implementations never silently fork on a component-mutating or
membership-changing commit.
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: WIRE-03, CONV-01, CONV-02, CONV-03, CONV-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. A staged commit that drops the `app_data_dictionary`, drops a required component, or rewrites a required component's bytes outside a validated `AppDataUpdate` is rejected pre-merge, identically on the send, inbound, and convergence/replay paths.
2. Every membership-changing commit results in admin ⊆ member-leaves in the resulting epoch; a removal-without-policy-update commit that MDK deems illegal is rejected identically by marmot-ts.
3. On being removed from a group, marmot-ts emits a self-removed notification, marks the group removed-inactive with no further outbound, and classifies subsequent input for that group as SelfEvicted/stale.
4. Group-state-change notifications are attributed to their originating `commit_digest` and are withdrawn — including clearing removal markers — when that commit is superseded on rewind.
5. Run against MDK's own-confirmed-commit scenario vectors (#706/#723/#702/#724): a device's own published+confirmed commit is never rolled back in favor of a same-epoch sibling; a clean pass requires no code change, and any divergence found is fixed before this phase closes (verify-first).
   **Plans**: 11/11 plans executed

Plans:

- [x] 03-08-PLAN.md
- [x] 03-09-PLAN.md
- [x] 03-10-PLAN.md
- [x] 03-11-PLAN.md

**Wave 1**

- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Pure core validators: app-component integrity (MDK attribution rule), admin/leaf coupling (resulting-epoch invariant), and the shared `validateCommitLegality` seam adapter
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — Inbound result vocabulary widening (rejection `reason`, `self-evicted` skip, `SelfEvicted` outcome, `stateInvalidated`) plus the `StateNotification` model and its bounded commit-digest ledger
- [x] 03-03-PLAN.md — CONV-04 verify-first: native Vitest tests for own-confirmed-commit protection and dual-ordering determinism, with conditional minimal remediation

**Wave 2** _(depends on Wave 1)_

- [x] 03-04-PLAN.md — Receive-side seams: proposal-capture side channel, inbound commit rejection gate, and dropped candidate edges in fork recovery
- [x] 03-05-PLAN.md — Engine-side seams: admin-policy auto-coupling + `AdminDepletionError` on send, the pre-wrap legality throw, and winner-chain validation on tree-fed re-convergence

**Wave 3** _(depends on Wave 2)_

- [x] 03-06-PLAN.md — CONV-02: `SelfEvicted` classification before peel, engine-level outbound block, persisted removed-inactive marker with load-time realization, plus the folded `rejectedEvents` DoS todo

**Wave 4** _(depends on Wave 3)_

- [x] 03-07-PLAN.md — CONV-03: commit-digest-attributed state notifications, rewind-scoped withdrawal via the ledger, and removal-marker clearing on supersession

### Phase 03.1: Phase 3 Review Closure (INSERTED)

**Goal**: Close the findings that held Phase 3's completion, so the phase's five success
criteria are true in the code rather than only claimed. Three code-review rounds each found
blockers in the previous round's fixes (7 → 4 → 5); this phase closes the remainder as planned
work with verification, rather than a fourth self-graded fix pass.
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: CONV-02, CONV-03 (completion of Phase 3's scope)
**Scope note**: CR-08 and CR-11 are **excluded** — the own-commit convergence defect class moved
to Phase 4 for a structural fix (porting `OwnCommitConvergenceStamp`). See
`.planning/phases/04-feature-parity-conformance-vectors/04-REFERENCE-FINDINGS.md`.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. A `removed` event raised during `fromClientState` load reaches the consumer: `GroupRegistry.track()`'s forwarder is attached before realization can emit, so CR-10's durable marker cannot make the loss permanent. The round-2 `EventEmitter.prototype` spy workaround in `removed.test.ts` is gone, replaced by an assertion on the real consumer path. (CR-12)
2. `send({ kind: "selfUpdate" })` runs a commit-authorization gate, and the `commit` seam's gate scans the by-reference proposal union — the same set every peer's inbound gate scans — so marmot-ts cannot author a commit that a conformant peer rejects as non-admin per `refs/marmot/protocol-core/group-messaging.md`. (CR-13)
3. A locally-authored commit derives and ledger-records its state notifications, so CONV-03's withdrawal invariant holds for our own commits and not only for inbound ones. A local commit also emits `historyChanged` when it grows the tree. (CR-14, WR-25)
4. The `StateNotificationLedger` uses digest-keyed O(1) lookup and correctness-safe `min(anchorEpoch, oldest tree epoch)` pruning, so `record()` is not O(n) and no candidate-namable entry is pruned. `maxRewindCommits: Infinity` explicitly remains memory-unbounded until the deferred `GroupHistoryTree` pruning capability lands. (WR-02, interacts with WR-14; D-05/D-06)
5. `#sweepTree` is gated on payload delivery rather than on eviction, so the D-13 self-eviction short-circuit does not starve the CONV-03 rewind path. (WR-07 — note round 3 found the round-1 remedy for this finding was itself wrong.)
6. No `MIP-NN` citation remains in any Phase 3-touched source file; each is replaced by its `refs/marmot/...` path per `refs/marmot/mip-coverage.md`. (WR-24, 21 sites)
7. The remaining re-derived round-1 carry-forwards (WR-03..WR-05, WR-08..WR-13 and the infos) are each either fixed or explicitly recorded as accepted with a rationale in `deferred-items.md` — none silently dropped.

### Phase 4: Feature Parity & Conformance Vectors

**Goal**: marmot-ts's LeafNode/KeyPackage bytes match the reference's SafeAAD advertisement,
MDK's own conformance-simulator test vectors run as automated cross-impl checks rather than
manual spot-checks, and own-commit convergence metadata is recorded at confirm time (porting
MDK's `OwnCommitConvergenceStamp`) instead of reconstructed at recovery time — which closes
the Phase 3 CR-08/CR-11 defect class structurally rather than by further incremental patching.
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: WIRE-04, CONF-01
**Reference basis**: `04-REFERENCE-FINDINGS.md` (read from `refs/marmot` @ `4ad4ae2`,
`refs/mdk` @ `790eb86`; submodule bump `d8ab0ac`)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. Leaf/KeyPackage `app_components` advertise `0x0001` and an empty SafeAAD (`0x0002`) entry, matching MDK's leaf dictionary byte-for-byte; safe_aad is still rejected as group-component state.
2. The `nostr-routing-v1-*` byte fixtures (`valid-state`, `valid-update`, `invalid-duplicate-relay`) pass as automated tests against `src/core/components/nostr-routing.ts` encode/decode, including the duplicate-relay reject case.
3. The convergence/admin-policy/fork-recovery scenario vectors (`convergence-committer-selected`, `convergence-witness-selected`, `admin-policy-update`, `group-data-update`, `group-data-fork-recovery`, `concurrent-invite-fork-recovery`, and related manifest entries) run as an automated parity harness against `src/engine/fork-recovery.ts` and related convergence code.
4. The Phase 1 proof-v2 Rust-signed → TS-verified round-trip is wired up as a permanent, repeatable automated test rather than a one-off manual check.
5. An own commit's convergence metadata — authenticated committer, authorization-aware ordering priority, and consumed proposal references — is recorded when the staged commit is confirmed and persisted alongside its wire bytes, so fork recovery after a restart never reconstructs a proposal set from a parent snapshot. Concretely: `framedCommitProposalsWithSender` is no longer on the own-commit path, and the CR-08 fall-through in `src/engine/fork-recovery.ts` cannot drop a self-authored candidate. (Ports `OwnCommitConvergenceStamp`, `refs/mdk/crates/traits/src/message.rs:23`.)
6. A commit whose candidate parent cannot be resolved is **deferred**, not dropped, while its authenticated source epoch is inside the rollback horizon, with epoch-based expiry `canonical_tip_epoch - commit_source_epoch > max_rewind_commits` — per `refs/marmot/protocol-core/convergence.md`. The known-state and `#treeResolution` seams agree on what a refusal does.
7. `restart-delivery-faults.v1.json` runs as an automated test, closing the persist → reload → converge coverage gap that allowed CR-08 and CR-09 to ship green through two review rounds. `publish-fail.v1.json` and `invite-publish-fail.v1.json` likewise cover the publish-before-apply rollback path.
8. Cross-impl comparison uses the canonical snapshot projection defined in `refs/marmot/foundation/conformance.md` (group id, epoch, `SHA256` of serialized `GroupContext`, exporter commitment `MLS-Exporter("marmot", "convergence-conformance-v1", 32)`, leaves in index order, `app_data_dictionary` entries, lifecycle, convergence status, per-input dispositions) rather than an ad-hoc field-by-field comparison.
9. The convergence-policy deltas from the updated contract are implemented: `DEFAULT_CONVERGENCE_POLICY` carries `max_convergence_pass_ms` (v1 default `5000`) measured on the local monotonic clock and never extended by later input; the scheduler does not admit inbound input into a new pass while the lifecycle is `PendingPublish` or `Merging`; and after a bounded pass settles in `Stable`, one already-queued admin-authorized local intent gets one preparation attempt before another pass opens solely because more inbound input is queued.

### Phase 04.1: Terminal Group Disbanding (INSERTED)

**Goal**: Implement the new `marmot.group.lifecycle.v1` app component and its terminal
`disbanded` state, including the convergence rule that a disband candidate is always admitted
through a bounded convergence pass. Marked INSERTED mechanically by `/gsd-phase`; this is new
spec scope surfaced by the 2026-08-06 reference sweep, not urgent remediation.
**Depends on**: Phase 4 (shares the convergence-pass machinery)
**Requirements**: TBD (new — not in the original v1.0 catchup requirement set)
**Reference**: `refs/marmot/app-components/group-lifecycle-v1.md` (new in `4ad4ae2`),
`refs/marmot/protocol-core/convergence.md` "Fork detection"
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. `marmot.group.lifecycle.v1` encodes and decodes byte-for-byte per its component doc, and participates in `app_data_dictionary` component-integrity validation like any other required component.
2. A valid Commit that changes the component to `disbanded` forces `Stable → Recovering` on admission **even when it is a linear edge and no divergent edge exists**, so terminalization can only occur after branch selection.
3. That forced transition does **not** restart either convergence timer, resnapshot `pass_base_epoch`, or give the disband candidate special branch-scoring priority — it is a terminalization boundary, not a scoring rule.
4. Once `disbanded` is canonical, the group is terminal: no further outbound, and subsequent input is classified consistently with the existing removed-inactive handling.
   **Plans**: TBD

Plans:

- [ ] TBD (run /gsd-plan-phase 04.1 to break down)

### Phase 5: Quality Gate

**Goal**: The full test suite is green on every supported runtime, and every catch-up change
with a byte-exact MDK counterpart has been cross-checked against the Rust reference output —
the milestone is shippable.
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Requirements**: QA-01, QA-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. `pnpm vitest run` exits 0 on Node 20, Node 22, and Node 24.
2. `deno run -A --node-modules-dir=auto npm:vitest run` exits 0 on Deno 2.
3. `bun run vitest run` exits 0 on Bun latest and Bun 1.1.
4. Every catch-up change with a byte-exact MDK counterpart (proof v2, KeyPackage lifetime, tag cardinality, SafeAAD dictionary bytes) has been cross-checked against the Rust reference output and the result recorded.
   **Plans**: TBD
