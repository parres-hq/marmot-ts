 * gate yet (that is B5) — so when a convergence fork rewind abandons a branch,
 * the payloads delivered on it MUST be retracted with an `invalidated`
 * notification. This ledger lets the engine find exactly those payloads on a
 * rewind.
 *
 * It holds no protocol state of its own; entries are pruned only below the
 * oldest state still named by retained history or the fork tree. A finite,
 * pruned tree can bound this ledger. With an unpruned full-history tree — and
 * especially `maxRewindCommits: Infinity` — correctness requires unbounded
 * retention until tree pruning exists. Mirrors the bookkeeping darkmatter does in
 * `distributed_convergence.rs` (`AppMessageInvalidated`).
